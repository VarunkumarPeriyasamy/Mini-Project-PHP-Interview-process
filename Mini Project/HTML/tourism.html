        <div><p id="about">Tourism is travel for pleasure or business, also the theory and practice of touring, 
            the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours.
             The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, 
             in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only",
              as people "travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for 
              leisure and not less than 24 hours,
               business and other purposes".Tourism can be domestic (within the traveller's own country) or international, 
            and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's.</p></div>
