        <p id="about"> <b> Wedding Photography </b></p>
        <div><p id="about">Wedding photography is a specialty in photography that is primarily focused on the photography of events and activities relating to weddings.
            It may include other types of portrait photography of the couple before the official wedding day, 
            such as a pre-wedding engagement session 
            (photographs are later used for the couple wedding invitations). On the official wedding day, 
            the photographer(s) will attempt to provide portrait photography, 
           as well as documentary photography coverage to document the different wedding events and rituals throughout the wedding day(s).</p></div>
