        <p id="about"> <b> Birthday Photography </b></p>
        <div><p id="about">A birthday is the anniversary of the birth of a person, or figuratively of an institution. 
            Birthdays of people are celebrated in numerous cultures,
            often with birthday gifts, birthday cards, a birthday party, or a rite of passage.
            Many religions celebrate the birth of their founders or religious figures with special holidays 
            (e.g. Christmas, Mawlid, Buddha's Birthday, and Krishna Janmashtami).
            There is a distinction between birthday and birthdate: the former, except for February 29, 
            occurs each year, while the latter is the complete date when a person was born.</p></div>
